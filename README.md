## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**LegendJurai/LegendJurai** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

Hey! My name is Leonie, but you can call me Lilo! I am from Germany and I am quite new to CodÃ©dex, GitHub and to coding in general! In here, I will continuously upload new projects, mostly something related to CodÃ©dex (f.e. Checkpoint Projects). I would be very happy to meet you and we can exchange our interets and knowledge about coding! Also, I am very interested and open to learn from you!

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on CodÃ©dex!
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and Java
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about anything!
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: Here or on CodÃ©dex with the same username!

Furthermore I enjoy dancing, playing the piano and painting! I am also a LeagueOfLegends player, but don't worry - I am not toxic at all! I am usually the one who are hurt after somebody insults me haha!
